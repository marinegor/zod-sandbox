## Introduction

The Zod Sandbox is a web application that allows you to interactively test and experiment with the Zod library. Zod is a powerful TypeScript-first library for data validation, parsing, and serialization. With this sandbox, you can quickly prototype and visualize how Zod schemas work with your data.

## Features

- Live editing of Zod schemas and data.
- Syntax highlighting with CodeMirror.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the Zod Sandbox up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zod-sandbox.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd zod-sandbox
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Open your browser:**

   The development server should now be running. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the Zod Sandbox.

## Usage

Once the Zod Sandbox is running in your browser, you'll see the code editors on the left and a result panel on the right. You can start by writing your own data and Zod schema.

To see the validation results, click the "Validate" button or press the keys `Ctrl + Enter`. This will display the outcome of the validation process, helping you understand how Zod validates data against schemas.
